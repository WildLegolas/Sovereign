# Sovereign

This is a private messaging platform that features a title screen animation and encrypts messages 
with 64 ASCII character strings for each character in the string before sending it to the
virtual private server to send to the other end. Currently it is only planned for use of two users
at a time, due to directly connecting to a host is not possible with one user using linux and the other
using windows. Future plans to make it accessible for multiple users at a time may be implemented in a
more deliberate manner.
